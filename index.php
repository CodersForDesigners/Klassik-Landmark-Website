	Aerodynamics to improve ventilation

	A direct benefit of the 'wing-shaped' towers, better airflow around the buildings. Placing 3 balconies on this aerodynamic curve significantly boosts the flow of air into all rooms. Klassik Landmark has more balconies per apartment than any other project in the vicinity.


	Large openings, more balconies, more sunlight 
	
	The sliding doors that lead to a balcony are a much larger openings, compared to a regular window, they let in more sunlight and fresh air.


	Bright airy kitchen and utility 
	
	The Kitchen is positioned closer to the building line, it opens out into a fully ventilated utility. This is a best in class feature.


	20% higher room volume 

	The ‘flat-slab’ engineering upgrade allows for larger room sizes, an improved ceiling height of 9’6” and no visible beams, because there are no beams. All internal walls are not load bearing. 


	Takeover a Fresh Apartment Engineering Upgrade 

	We changed one engineering process to make your new apartment feel new.  The Doors, Sanitary Fixtures and Kitchen Counter are installed just before you move in. They are not soiled by construction workers. The apartment truly feels brand new.
